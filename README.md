# Devin Status Checker

> This Chrome extension is designed to check the status of Devin sessions and notify the user accordingly.

## Motivation

Before the Devin Status Checker extension, users had to manually monitor their Devin AI sessions, often switching back and forth between tasks to check if Devin was waiting for input. This was not only inefficient but also disruptive to the workflow.

To address this, the Devin Status Checker Chrome extension was developed. It automates the monitoring process by checking the status of Devin sessions in the background. When Devin's status changes to 'waiting', the extension sends an immediate notification. This allows users to focus on other tasks with the assurance that they won't miss the moment Devin requires their attention. By streamlining this process, the extension enhances productivity and integrates AI assistance into the user's multitasking routine seamlessly.

## Features

- Automatic checking of Devin status at regular intervals.
- Notifications to alert the user when Devin is awaiting their input.
