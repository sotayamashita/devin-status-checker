# Devin Status Checker

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build%20with%20Devin-8A2BE2)](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin)

> This Chrome extension is designed to check the status of Devin sessions and notify the user accordingly.

## Motivation

I created a Chrome extension to monitor Devin's session. When its status changes to "waiting," the extension sends a notification. While Devin completes tasks, I want to do other things, but I want to know when Devin is waiting for my response, so I created this extension. This Chrome extension's behavior was created by Devin ðŸŽ‰.

## Features

- Automatic checking of Devin status at regular intervals.
- Notifications to alert the user when Devin is awaiting their input.
